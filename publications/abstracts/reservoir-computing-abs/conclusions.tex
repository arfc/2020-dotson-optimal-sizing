\section{Conclusions}

We have demonstrated that even a basic \acrshort{ESN} can
predict the evolution of dynamic systems as others have
\cite{pathak_model-free_2018,wikner_combining_2020,bianchi_reservoir_2020}.
Future work will include:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Identifying ideal input vectors, whether a single value for net demand
  history will suffice or some combination of values (e.g. local weather and
  total demand) will improve predictive power.
  \item Grid searches to tune hyperparameters.
  \item Taking advantage of fast model training to perform uncertainty analysis.
\end{enumerate}
Fairer comparisons on the effectiveness of training length will be done by
fixing the prediction time period for each ESN.
Accurate predictions of chaotic systems, like wind energy production, will
enable nuclear power plants to improve their economic feasibility through
relaxed load following.
