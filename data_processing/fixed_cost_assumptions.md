## Scenario 11: Addition of fixed costs
by Olek Yardas

Fixed costs for non-automobile technologies came from Report SL-014940, a capital cost study by Sargent & Lundy commissioned by USEIA. Fixed costs for automobile technologies comes from averaging MSRP data for cars from fueleconomy.gov.

### General Assumptions for fixed costs for each technology

#### Capital costs
Capital costs for a given technology are divided into owner's costs, and engineering, procurenent, and construction (EPC) contractor costs. Capitcal costs account for all costs incurred during construction of the power plant before coming online.
The S&L report makes the following assumptions for the capital costs:
 - The power plant developer/owner hires an EPC contractor for construction.
 - EPC contractor cost includes procurement of equipment, materials, and all construction labor.
 - The owner costs includes project development, permitting, legal, outside-the-fence-line costs (electrical/gas interconnection), contingency, etc
 - Electrical interconnecction does not require substation upgrades.

Locational and environmental adjustment factors are in the appendices of the paper.

#### Operating and maintenance costs.
Fixec O&M costs include routine labor, materials and contract services, and administrative and general expenses. For solar and wind all O&M costs are treated as fixed costs.

#### Electrolysis plant (ELECTROL)
The capital investment cost for electrolysis cells comes from the 2018 paper "The investment cost of electrolysis - A comparison of cost studies from the past 30 years". In this paper, the estimated investment cost of alkaline electrolyzers for the future (2030) is between 787 and 906 euros/kW output. According to the "Technology Roadmap Hydrogen and Fuel Cells", the efficienty of alkaline electrolyser cells is between 65 and 82%. The average of these costs is 846.5 euros/kW output. In USD this is $1030.19 $/kW

The fixed cost is much trickier to determine, and I have not found a good estimate for this yet.
#### Nuclear power plant (NUCLEAR)

This case uses two Westinghouse AP1000 reactors as a model plant.
Fixed O&M costs come from those listed at the top of this document.

#### Wind power (IMPWIND)

This case is a 200MW capacity onshore wind farm located in the Great Plains region. Land is abundant and suitable for turbine siting.

Assume 71 turbines with nominal rating of 2.8MW, 125-meter rotor diameter, 90-meter hub height.

Fixed O&M cost estimates assume full-service arrangement wiht O&M contractor that provides labor, management, parts replacement, collection system, and substation. The estimate does not include land lease royalties, property taxes, or insurance.



#### Solar plant (IMPSOLAR)

150 MW AC solar PV facility w/ single axis tracking.
Uses 195 MW DC of 1500 V monocrystalline PERC modules with independent row trackers that are placed in a north south orientation with east west tracking.
Facility uses 150MW AC of central inverters.

Single axis tracking requires large land useage.

Fixed O&M cost estimate includes preventative and unscheduled maintenance, module cleaing, inverter maintenance reserve, and land lease.


#### Automobiles

The fixed cost for automobile technology is based on paying off the principal cost of the vehicle over the vehicle's lifetime. This currently does not account for interest rate on a car loan.

I obtained the principal costs by averaging MSRP values from fueleconomy.gov
