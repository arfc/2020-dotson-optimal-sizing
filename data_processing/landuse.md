# Solar

* Raw: 8.1 acres/MW(e) capacity [1]
* Considering everything else: 43.5 acres/MW(e) capacity [1]


# Wind

* Raw: 60 acres/MW(e) capacity [1]
* Considering everything else: 70.6 acres/MW(e) capacity [1]


# Nuclear

* Raw: 0.901 acres/MW(e) capacity (for large scale power plant of 1,000 MW) [1]
* Considering everything else: 12.7 acres/MW(e) capacity, (1,000 MW) [1]
* need for another source for smaller reactors


# ABBOTT: Natural gas and coal

* Nat gas: 
	- Raw: 0.343 acres/MW(e) capacity [1]
	- Considering everything else: 12.4 acres/MW(e) capacity [1]
* Coal:
	- Raw: 0.699 acres/MW(e) capacity [1]
	- Considering everything else: 12.2 acres/MW(e) capacity [1]

* Tot ~ 800,000 lbs/hour [2]
	- 2 dual fuel (nat gas and fuel oil) ~ 2 x 150,000 lbs/h ~ 300,000
	- 3 coal-fired boilers [2] ~ 350,000 lbs/h
	- 2 Heat Recovery Steam Generators ~ 40,000 - 110,000 lbs/h

- Tot = 300,000 + 350,000 + 110,000 = 760,000
- nat gas = 300,000 + 110,000 = 410,000 ~ /Tot = 0.54
- coal = 350,000 ~ /Tot = 0.46

* Specific land-use
	- Raw: 0.54 * 0.343 + 0.46 * 0.699 = 0.51 acres/MW(e)
	- Considering everything else: 0.54 * 12.4 + 0.46 * 12.2 = 12.31

* This may need to be in lbs/hour or MW(th)
