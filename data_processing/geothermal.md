Two types on campus:
* shallow, horizontal ground loop systems
* closed-loop 40 450-foot deep vertical boreholes


Geothermal project installed on campus in FY20 that saves 2,839 MMBTU/year.

Add campus-wide geothermal enhanced heat recovery chiller plant.
Convert entire campus to hot water heating.

Heat recovery chillers (HRC) and Geothermal


[3]

Geothermal heat pumps: can produced chilled and hot water.

A district geothermal system would reduce the use of fossil fuels on campus, but would increase the campus average demand for electricity by about 18 MW over our current average demand of about 52 MW.

2025: similar system to the one at Ball State University
2035: equal size

Each installation will provide 80,000 MWh/year of thermal energy, by using 20,000 MWh/year of electricity (COP of 4).
The system will provide the chilled water needs.
The electricity demand (direct + geothermal) is 290,000 MWh/year.
Biomass burners will cover the remaining 90,000 MWh heating needs.

2015: Heat Demand: 500,000 MWh/year

[Me]

heat_demand = 500,000 MWh/year
cop = 4 [3]
electrical_demand = 125,000 MWh/year = 14.3 MWh/year of electricity
